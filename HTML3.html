				BY EMMANUEL ROMERO L.A. Cicero Richard Zare Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether its the summer grass that tickles your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carries special chemical markers.

But doing these analyses has been complex and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.
